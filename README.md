# 💼 Finance EDA (Monthly Branch Reports)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on internal financial reports submitted monthly by regional offices of a company operating across various countries. Each row in the dataset represents one branch’s monthly report containing key metrics like revenue, expenses, profit margins, ratings, and transaction volumes.

The analysis strictly follows the structure used in previous EDA projects (FIFA, Publishing) using Python libraries: **pandas**, **numpy**, and **matplotlib**.
